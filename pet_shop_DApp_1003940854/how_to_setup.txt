############################################
Trouble Shooting (only on new ganache setup it will go away when the connection is stable, the DApp itself is bug-free)

The DApp and all functions should be ready once it is properly setup
But it might appear with all pets adopted (only happened once and never seen after)
Just refresh the page and it will be solved

The transaction may prompt Internal-RPC ERROR (happens only when switching accounts and ganache is newly set up)
It is a cold-start problem and can be solved by following ways:
1. refresh the page

2. Manually switch account in the Metamask: 
click the localhost icon in Metamask pannel 
you will see the account dropdown list
click the hiden menu (3 dots) and select switch to this account

3. wait for a couple of minutes and rerun the DApp in a new terminal
